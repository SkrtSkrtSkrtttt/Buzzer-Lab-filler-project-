# Buzzer-Lab-filler-project-
In this project you will incorporate a buzzer into the physical Arduino to make noise.
Principle Concept: 
As a type of electronic buzzer with integrated structure, buzzers, which are supplied by DC power, are
widely used in computers, printers, photocopiers, alarms, electronic toys, automotive electronic devices,
telephones, timers and other electronic products for voice devices. Buzzers can be categorized as active
and passive ones (see the following picture). Turn the pins of two buzzers face up, and the one with a
green circuit board is a passive buzzer, while the other enclosed with a black tape is an active one.
